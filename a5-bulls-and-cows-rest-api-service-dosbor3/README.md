# Bulls and Cows

A guessing game that generates a four-digit number each game.  The generated number must generate unique digits.  For each round, the user guesses a number and is told the exact and partial digit matches.  An exact match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit in the correct position.  A partial match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit but in the wrong position.  Once the number is guessed (exact matches for all digits) the user wins the game.  

## User Story

AS a Bulls and Cows player,
I WANT to be able to enter my four-digit guess each round
SO THAT I may be informed of exact and partial matches, until the generated number is guessed correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a generated four-digit number with all digits being unique
WHEN the user makes a guess
THEN the user will be informed of their updated results
